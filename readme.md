# About company

“Japosha Sushi” is a small, family-owned company that specializes in the sale of sushi and is located in Estonia, Tallinn.The company was founded by a graduate from a cooking school who had a dream to start his own business. Throughout the entire time, the founder of the company is Mihhail Spiridonov. Several people work under his leadership, most of the employees began their journey at the very beginning when the company was just created. The company had a good performance and the trust of people in the city until recently, as soon as the COVID-19 epidemic began, its performance dropped sharply and the owner of the company wondered what he could do.

At the moment, the company has its own website, which only shows the range of products, delivery, and contacts. Oftentimes, the transaction between the buyer and the seller took place in cash on arrival or with delivery by courier, but still, only cash was used. If you want to order something, then you must call the number, after which you dictate your order, and the person will fill in all the information for you. Recently, the company began to have big problems due to the COVID-19, people started ordering less due to the fact that they had to come to the place and the owner became interested in a website where it would be possible to make purchases and place orders.
# Solution
Our group would like to propose a solution for this problem. We will create a web-site where customers can create their order in an easier way and without problems. This will increase the efficiency of employees who no longer need to answer calls, they will be able to receive orders on the website, which will simplify their task.
# Implementation:

Customer data: ID; name, email, etc. 
Information about types of sushi and ingredients.
Order data: customer data, product with price, taxes and discounts, total price, etc.
